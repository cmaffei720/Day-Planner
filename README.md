# Day-Planner

A Day Planner you can use to schedule tasks from 9 am to 5 pm
If the hour has passed already, the task block will be gray (past)
If the hour is currently happening, the task block will be red (present)
If the hour is in the future, the task block will be green (future)

This doc uses Moment.js to format the date and pull the current hour
This doc uses jQuery to add classes to divs based on its relation to the current hour
This doc uses Local Storage to save your tasks into local storage

*Note - hitting one Save button will save all of your current tasks, not just the task for that specific Task block
